# MyExpensesDB
A very basic and simple SQL Server database. I started this project to practice my basic database creation knowledge, boost my skills for T-SQL and SQL Server knowledge on on-premises and cloud.

 The second purpose of this project, I want a database that I can update everyday. Also this database will serve as a database to record all my daily bought items, calculate my per cut-off expenses and savings. 
 
 I will just use Excel with add-ins that will connect to SQL Server and enter records.
 
For my privacy, I will only show the database creation, management, & etc not my personal spending records :)
